# Blockly.js
A simple modification of the Blockly sample app (Google's Blockly) that has some extra features and uses a custom font.

This sample app uses an `npm` setup for Blockly and block code compiles to JavaScript. As of now, no extra blocks have been added via JSON, I tried but failed. You can try
if you would like.
